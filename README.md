I work as a consultant in quantitative finance, both in the areas of data processing and quantitative analysis.

My main interests are:

1. Real time processing of financial market data
2. Historical processing of financial market data
3. Quantitative Analysis methods, including ML and AI
4. Classic UNIX distributed programming and X11/Xt/Motif programming (more as a hobby).

Feel free to reach me if you have anything to share (www.linkedin.com/in/marioemmanuel). I write some light articles in Medium too (https://medium.com/@m.emmanuel)
